### Files Modified
- None (all new files)

### Decisions Made

1. **Tech Stack Finalized**:
   - Frontend: React Native + Expo (beginner-friendly, cross-platform)
   - Backend: Firebase (no server management, scales automatically)
   - Database: Cloud Firestore (real-time, NoSQL)
   - Why: Balance of simplicity, scalability, and enterprise-quality

2. **Core Constraints Defined**:
   - 10 swipes/day (forces thoughtful decisions)
   - 5 max matches (reduces ghosting, encourages engagement)
   - 30-day pause (keeps community active)
   - All constraints have clear algorithms and edge case handling

3. **No Premium Tier in MVP**:
   - Keep MVP simple
   - Validate core concept first
   - Add monetization after product-market fit

4. **Development Approach**:
   - Documentation-first (understand before coding)
   - Enterprise-quality from day one
   - Explain every function's purpose
   - Test each feature as it's built

5. **Memory Strategy Across Sessions**:
   - Use Git for version history
   - Use PROJECT_STATE.md for quick context
   - Use CHANGELOG.md for detailed progress
   - Update documentation after each session

### Blockers Encountered
None

### Questions Raised
1. Swipe reset: UTC midnight vs. local midnight?
   - **Recommendation**: UTC for simplicity in MVP, consider local time in v2
2. Gender options beyond male/female?
   - **Recommendation**: Include non-binary and "prefer not to say"
3. Should matches expire if no messages exchanged?
   - **Recommendation**: NO for MVP, revisit later

### Metrics
- Lines of documentation written: ~11,000+
- Files created: 12
- Folders created: 7
- Git commits: 0 (pending)
- Code written: 0 (documentation phase)

### Next Session Goals
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install Node.js
   - Install Expo CLI
   - Set up code editor (VS Code recommended)
2. **Firebase Setup**:
   - Create Firebase project
   - Enable Authentication
   - Create Firestore database
   - Set up Storage
3. **Initialize React Native Project**:
   - Create Expo project
   - Set up navigation structure
   - Configure Firebase SDK
4. **First Screens**:
   - Build welcome screen
   - Build signup screen
   - Build login screen
   - Connect to Firebase Auth

### Notes
- This was a pure documentation/planning session
- No code has been written yet
- All architecture, constraints, data models, and APIs fully documented
- Ready to begin development in next session with complete understanding of system
- User explicitly requested no "vibe-coding" - wants to understand every function
- Documentation approach allows understanding without technical background

### Files to Review Before Next Session
For quick context reload:
1. PROJECT_STATE.md (current status)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md (system overview)
3. CONSTRAINTS.md (business logic)

For deep dive on specific topics:
- DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (when working on data models)
- API_REFERENCE.md (when building endpoints)
- USER_FLOW.md (when building UI screens)

## Session 2 - 2025-10-18
**Type**: Environment Setup & Firebase Configuration
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Summary
Successfully set up the complete development environment, created Firebase project with all required services, initialized React Native app with Expo, and built the first working screen. App successfully tested on iPhone via Expo Go - major milestone achieved!

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Verified Node.js v22.16.0 and npm v11.6.0 already installed
- ✅ Installed Expo CLI globally (v6.3.12)
- ✅ Created Firebase project: `scoop-dating`
- ✅ Enabled Firebase Authentication (Email/Password provider)
- ✅ Created Firestore database (region: us-east1, test mode)
- ✅ Set up Firebase Storage (billing plan enabled for free tier)
- ✅ Initialized React Native app with Expo in `src/frontend/`
- ✅ Installed Firebase SDK (firebase package)
- ✅ Installed React Navigation dependencies (@react-navigation/native, @react-navigation/stack)
- ✅ Created project folder structure (config, screens, components, services, utils)
- ✅ Created Firebase configuration file with credentials
- ✅ Built WelcomeScreen component with Scoop branding
- ✅ Updated App.js to render WelcomeScreen
- ✅ Tested app successfully on iPhone via Expo Go
- ✅ Committed all changes to Git (commit hash: 10b246e)

### Files Created
- `src/frontend/config/firebase.js` - Firebase initialization and service exports
- `src/frontend/screens/WelcomeScreen.js` - Landing screen with purple Scoop branding
- `src/frontend/App.js` - Main app entry point (modified from default)
- `src/frontend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `src/frontend/app.json` - Expo configuration
- `src/frontend/.gitignore` - Expo-specific gitignore
- `src/frontend/index.js` - Expo entry point
- Folders: config/, screens/, components/, services/, utils/

### Files Modified
None (all new files in this session)

### Decisions Made
1. **Firebase Region**: us-east1 instead of us-central1
   - **Reason**: us-central1 no longer supports free Storage tier
   - **Impact**: None for MVP, latency difference negligible

2. **Billing Plan**: Upgraded to Blaze (pay-as-you-go)
   - **Reason**: Required for Firebase Storage
   - **Mitigation**: Set budget alert at $5/month
   - **Expected cost**: $0/month for MVP phase

3. **VS Code confirmed**: User already downloaded, perfect choice
   - **Extensions recommended**: ES7 React snippets, Prettier, ESLint, GitLens, React Native Tools

4. **No GitHub Copilot**:
   - **Reason**: Learning-focused approach, Claude Code provides better explanations
   - **Future**: Revisit in 6 months when coding more independently

5. **Testing Method**: Expo Go on iPhone
   - **Reason**: Windows doesn't support iOS simulator (requires Mac)
   - **Alternative**: Can test on Android emulator or web browser if needed

6. **Command Prompt over PowerShell**:
   - **Reason**: PowerShell execution policy blocked npx
   - **Solution**: Use Command Prompt for all npm/npx commands

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Firebase Storage billing requirement**
   - **Issue**: New Firebase policy requires billing plan even for free tier
   - **Solution**: Enabled Blaze plan with $5 budget alert
   - **Time lost**: ~15 minutes

2. **PowerShell execution policy**
   - **Issue**: PowerShell blocked npx command ("scripts are disabled")
   - **Solution**: Switched to Command Prompt instead of changing policies
   - **Time lost**: ~5 minutes

3. **Port 8081 conflict**
   - **Issue**: Background Expo process still running, blocking port
   - **Solution**: Identified process (PID 13396) and killed it via taskkill
   - **Time lost**: ~5 minutes

4. **Expo QR code not visible in background mode**
   - **Issue**: Running expo start in background didn't show QR code
   - **Solution**: Instructed user to run npx expo start in their own terminal
   - **Time lost**: ~10 minutes

### Notes
- **Major milestone**: First time user saw their app running on a physical device!
- User is on Windows, so iOS simulator not available (requires Mac)
- Expo Go makes testing incredibly easy - scan QR code and app loads instantly
- Firebase free tier is very generous: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day, 5GB storage
- User confirmed understanding of Firebase scalability and costs
- Budget alert set at $5/month to prevent unexpected charges
- Git commit created but push requires GitHub Desktop authentication
- User asked excellent question about maintaining context across sessions (answered: PROJECT_STATE.md + CHANGELOG.md + Git commits)
