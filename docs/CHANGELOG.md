## Session 1 - 2025-10-17
**Type**: Documentation & Planning
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Summary
Created complete project foundation with comprehensive documentation explaining all system architecture, business logic, and data models. No code written yet - pure planning phase to ensure deep understanding before implementation.

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created project folder in OneDrive at `/My Files/Professional/Side Projects/Dating App - Scoop`
2. ✅ Initialized Git repository
3. ✅ Created folder structure:
   - `/docs` - Documentation
   - `/src/frontend` - Future React Native app
   - `/src/backend` - Future Cloud Functions
   - `/src/database` - Future Firestore rules
   - `/design` - Future wireframes/mockups
   - `/tests` - Future test files
4. ✅ Created `.gitignore` file
5. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation:

### Files Modified
- None (all new files)

### Decisions Made

1. **Tech Stack Finalized**:
   - Frontend: React Native + Expo (beginner-friendly, cross-platform)
   - Backend: Firebase (no server management, scales automatically)
   - Database: Cloud Firestore (real-time, NoSQL)
   - Why: Balance of simplicity, scalability, and enterprise-quality

2. **Core Constraints Defined**:
   - 10 swipes/day (forces thoughtful decisions)
   - 5 max matches (reduces ghosting, encourages engagement)
   - 30-day pause (keeps community active)
   - All constraints have clear algorithms and edge case handling

3. **No Premium Tier in MVP**:
   - Keep MVP simple
   - Validate core concept first
   - Add monetization after product-market fit

4. **Development Approach**:
   - Documentation-first (understand before coding)
   - Enterprise-quality from day one
   - Explain every function's purpose
   - Test each feature as it's built

5. **Memory Strategy Across Sessions**:
   - Use Git for version history
   - Use PROJECT_STATE.md for quick context
   - Use CHANGELOG.md for detailed progress
   - Update documentation after each session

### Blockers Encountered
None

### Questions Raised
1. Swipe reset: UTC midnight vs. local midnight?
   - **Recommendation**: UTC for simplicity in MVP, consider local time in v2
2. Gender options beyond male/female?
   - **Recommendation**: Include non-binary and "prefer not to say"
3. Should matches expire if no messages exchanged?
   - **Recommendation**: NO for MVP, revisit later

### Metrics
- Lines of documentation written: ~11,000+
- Files created: 12
- Folders created: 7
- Git commits: 0 (pending)
- Code written: 0 (documentation phase)

### Next Session Goals
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install Node.js
   - Install Expo CLI
   - Set up code editor (VS Code recommended)
2. **Firebase Setup**:
   - Create Firebase project
   - Enable Authentication
   - Create Firestore database
   - Set up Storage
3. **Initialize React Native Project**:
   - Create Expo project
   - Set up navigation structure
   - Configure Firebase SDK
4. **First Screens**:
   - Build welcome screen
   - Build signup screen
   - Build login screen
   - Connect to Firebase Auth

### Notes
- This was a pure documentation/planning session
- No code has been written yet
- All architecture, constraints, data models, and APIs fully documented
- Ready to begin development in next session with complete understanding of system
- User explicitly requested no "vibe-coding" - wants to understand every function
- Documentation approach allows understanding without technical background

### Files to Review Before Next Session
For quick context reload:
1. PROJECT_STATE.md (current status)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md (system overview)
3. CONSTRAINTS.md (business logic)

For deep dive on specific topics:
- DATABASE_SCHEMA.md (when working on data models)
- API_REFERENCE.md (when building endpoints)
- USER_FLOW.md (when building UI screens)
